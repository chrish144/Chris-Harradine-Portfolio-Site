            <p class="OV-W-S-K-P-INDT">I was Born in February 1976 & am now 45. I started my professional life at 12 working in restaurants in the school holidays and when I was sixteen I trained as a chef in a 5 star hotel. I then went on to cook in a number of local, Kent restaurants,
              before I became a chef in the merchant navy. After this, my early career as a chef culminated in me working at a specialist dietary retreat cooking for patients with addictive food disorders, for a top <i class="bnb">Harley Street Doctor.</i> His
              belief was that <i class="bnb">carbohydrates</i> are the main reason for food addictions and it is only now, after many years of research, that I can, not only confirm the accuracy of his philosophy, but also explain precisely why this is.

              In 1998 I decided to take a break and see the world some more so I went back to sea working for a luxury cruise line sailing around Alaska and the Caribbean. I statred my first contract as a <i class="bnb">Bar Steward</i> and went on to become an
              <i class="bnb">Assistant Cruise Director.</i> where I attained valuable stage and hosting experience. I found this role to be incredibly enjoyable and, although I still enjoy life onboard a cruise ship, I now prefer the life of a passenger.

            <p class="">
              After returning from sea I spent the next ten years in sales and marketing, working in London and the Southeast, within a variety of fields including; Technology Sales, and as a <i class="bnb">Senior Executive for a Web Design & Marketing Company,</i> I
              then went on to gain experience working for an, Industry leading, <i class="bnb">Contract Research, Pharma Publication.</i> At this point I was living in London and my next position was working for a world leading, <i class="bnb">Personal Performance Promoter.</i>

              In this role I was marketing training courses and seminars for global Leaders in the field of Personal Performance including: <i class="bnb">"Christopher Howard," "T. Harv Eker" and "Tony Robbins."</i> It was at this time that I utilised my contacts
              within the industry to become a <i class="bnb">Master Trainer of "NLP" Neuro Linguistic Programming.</i> I was also volunteering at this time for the UK's Largest personal development charity as editor of their monthly digital publication.

              Ten Years of Research & Study
            </h4>
            <p class="OV-W-S-K-P-INDT">
              For the past ten years I have been residing back in Kent and have, not only, returned to my career as a chef specialising in <i class="bnb">Alkaline, Vegan, Vegetarian & Gluten Free Cuisine,</i> I have also gained & developed a wide variety of skills &
              knowledge including; <i class="bnb">Web Design & Development, Cuisine Photography,</i> and most recently, I have started to learn <i class="bnb">Music Production.</i> I have also attained an enhanced, <i class="bnb">Quantum Perspective</i> on health, life, disease &, just about, the complete workings of the <i class="bnb">Entire
              Universe.</i>
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-7 OV-it OV-it-8">
            <p class="">
              The reason for my wide and varied skill set is because I have been researching the relationship between health, food and alternative ancient healing arts and the workings of, pretty much, <i class="bnb">all disease</i> for around 15 years. This curiosity was
              first sparked in my teens when I had an experience with a faith healer and then, later in my early twenties, this interest reignited when I discovered the ancient, marshal healing art of <i class="bnb">Chi Kung / Qi Gong,</i> derived from <i class="bnb">Shaolin Kung
              fu.</i>
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-8 OV-it OV-it-9">
            <p>
              The real breakthrough however, came in my mid-thirties when I discovered the principles of <i class="bnb">Electric Medicine</i> through pioneers of this field such as <i class="bnb">"Bob Beck" & "Dr Robert Becker"</i> The author of the <i class="bnb">"Body Electric"</i> and
              <i class="bnb">"Electric Medicine."</i> This coincided with my discovery of the principles of maintainingan alkaline balance in the body through diet from the 1930's, <i class="bnb">Three Time Nobel Prise Winner, "Dr Auto Walburg."</i> He proved that <i class="bnb">(No Disease, Not Even
              Cancer)</i> can exist within a <i class="bnb">healthy, alkaline body.</i>
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-9 OV-it OV-it-10">
            <p>
              The understanding, that it was the electrical balance of the body that was the defining factor between health and all disease, predominantly determined by our diet, allowed me to make the instant connection with the advanced, breathing
              and meditative techniques of the shaolin healing disciplines. However, this advanced knowledge of the workings of health plunged me even deeper down the rabbit hole of <i class="bnb">greater universal understanding</i> as I was then left asking the question; <i class="bnb">What is Qi / Chi ?</i> and more importantly how is it effected by the electrical balance of the body, and why is its presence vital for us to maintain optimal health?.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although practitioners of eastern medicine will explain that <i class="bnb">Qi / Chi or Kundalini,</i> is simply, life force or, vital force, which is the essence of all life in the universe, trying to explain this to most of the people you
              know, or a traditional practitioner of <i class="bnb">allopathic, western medicine,</i> alternatively known as a Dr or, <i class="bnb">Pharmaceutical Cash Cow</i> will, most likely, get you a condescending look and a smirk of ignorance.

              Future Mission Objectives
            </h4>
            <p class="OV-W-S-K-P-INDT">
              Therefore my mission was simple: prove the existence of <i class="bnb">Qi / Chi,</i> what it is and how it works. This was the part of the journey I was most unprepared for as it took me deep into the realms of <i class="bnb">Quantum Physics</i> and it was subsequently,
              by understanding the principles of <i class="bnb">super conduction and electromagnetic fields</i> primarily through the working of an ex, master mason, historian, and Egyptologist and author of the book <i class="bnb">"The Lost Secrets of the Ancient Ark,"</i> the late
              <i class="bnb">"Lawrence Gardener,"</i> that I understood how everything came together and this has lead me, over the past ten years of postulation and study, to conclude that the body, and every atom, cell, galaxy, star, sun, planet and the universe
              itself is "potentially," a <i class="bnb">Quantum Superconductor</i> implying that, <i class="bnb">(All Life)</i> has to follow this same set of rules with one exception, as I will soon explain.
            </p>

          </section>
          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-12 OV-it OV-it-13">
            <p>
              This conclusion, therefore, subsequently presupposes that <i class="bnb">(All Disease) from a cold to cancer</i> is brought on by the lack of this, <i class="bnb">Vital Superconductive Force</i> implying that every disease is simply, what I term as an <i class="bnb">EDD,</i> an
              <i class="bnb">Electron Deficit Disorder.</i> To elaborate further, what we see manifested as the symptoms of disease is the process of <i class="bnb">Homeostasis,</i> The body's way of maintaining a healthy alkaline, equilibrium.  Unfortunately the main cause of this is the western convenience diet as most of the foods we consume
              on a daily basis take life force from us, i.e. electrons, from our body, rather than providing us with them. This is, in part, due to the shortcomings of the traditional, nutritional modal as they are missing the whole point of <i class="bnb">why we
              need to consume food in the first place</i> and that is, for the same reason we need to breath, sleep and exercise and that's to acquire electrons to repair the body from oxidative, or, radical stress and to allow our immune system to
              buffer and neutralise a toxic environment to prevent this process from happening.

          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-13 OV-it OV-it-14">
            <p>
              For when the body is over acidic our cellular DNA can no longer receive quantum instruction regarding their purpose, consequently they then become <i class="bnb">pleomorphic</i> meaning, they revert back to a single cellular organism or <i class="bnb">fungus</i> and
              this means that they are then following the only set of rules that are not governed by the <i class="bnb">Quantum Universe</i> and that is, the rules of a parasite or pathogen. They operate by consuming our nutrition and breaking down our healthy cells
              through the process of <i class="bnb">glycolysis</i> i.e. fermentation.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="Overview-W-S-K__section-14 OV-it OV-it-15">
            <p>
              This fungal feast leaves in its wake the toxic, lactic deluge of the fermentation process, essentially turning the body into something akin to a vat of home brewed moonshine. It is this environment that then determines the homeostatic destiny of our health as it sends the, once healthy cells, into a catabolic breakdown,  ultimately leading to the inevitable cessation of life itself. Therefore <i class="bnb">homeostasis,</i> is what we see manifested as the symptoms of disease, aging and death as it is the process of the body trying to maintain a healthy environment, primarily; by  riding itself of its toxic load through any means possible. When the immune system has run out of resources to buffer and bolster its toxic environment the body will begin to shut down to face its inevitable demise.

                    This period has seen me studying and developing a variety of disciplines from web design and cuisine photography too alkaline vegan cookery and quantum science. I have also recently turned my hand back to a passion from my past
                    and started to learn music production to create soundtracks for my promotional and recipe videos to accompany my health and alkaline cuisine, books, websites and apps.

                    During this period I gained a wealth of experience in sales and marketing working in positions ranging from; web and SEO sales, at the dawn of the .com, too working in London selling Pharmaceutical Publications to the Pharma
                    industry and ground breaking , health and performance seminars and training courses for world leaders in the personal performance industry. I also attained valuable experience editing a charitable publication at this time.

                    My first contract with "Princess" was on the "Regal Princess" as a bar steward which encompassed all aspects of bar and cocktail service on a luxury cruise line, sailing around Alaska and the Caribbean. I then returned for my
                    second contract as an "Assistant Cruise Director" this role was predominantly that of a passenger entertainer, although there was a heavy emphasis on ship safety and in the event of an emergency I was incharge of the evacuation of
                    900 passengers and 50 crew. I enjoyed this position immensely although, it is not something I could see myself doing for a long period of time as it was extremely intense.

                    I started my professional life as a chef in a four star hotel on the south east coast of Kent in the UK, as a trainee chef. I then went on to work in a few busy local restaurants before I embarked upon a career at sea as an
                    assistant chef on a busy cross channel ferry, serving up to 2000 covers, six times a day. My early career as a chef culminated by working with patients with specialist dietary requirements and addictive food disorders in a private
                    rehabilitation retreat, for a top "Harley Street DR." I gained a great deal of knowledge and understanding whilst working as the second chef here as it allowed me to understand both; the day to day running of a busy kitchen and
                    the principles of adapting dishes that contained white flour and sugar to create healthy, delicious alternatives that everyone could eat. I believe this has helped me immensely with my current projects.

                    Although I was only a child at this point, from the age of 12 I spent my summers working in restaurant kitchens in the busy sea side town of Dymchurch, situated on the southeast coast of Kent. It was essentially this experience
                    that lead me to go on to work as a trainee chef in a four star hotel at the age of 16.
